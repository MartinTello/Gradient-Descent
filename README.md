# Gradien Descent Visualizer
This is a GUI program written in Matlab that helps to visualize the gradient descent method applied to linear regression.
This is the first version of the visualizer. Further work includes:
+ Rewrite the tool in an open source library (i.e. SciPy)
+ Work with threads in order to simultaneously plot all the figures.
+ Add an option to load custom datasets.
+ Add an option to select a plot and make it fullscreen.
+ Add a "Results" panel or tab, to show the slope and y-intersect final values.
